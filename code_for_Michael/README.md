This repository contains the following files:

1. 10_seconds_LLR_results.ipynb: this notebook shows LLR results for the two models (ALP and zero), when the ALP input model is averaged over 10 seconds. 
The background used in this analysis is also averaged over 10 seconds (average background level). This may be compared with this notebook: https://github.com/mcrnogor/paper-review/blob/master/code_for_Manuel_revised/6_difference_models.ipynb where the interval for the ALP signal was 25 seconds. Both of these grids are coarse. 

2. 80_vs_20s-backgrounds.ipynb: this notebook shows background rates averaged over 20 and 80 seconds (for the average background levels). 

3. time-averaged_ALP.ipynb: this notebook shows ALP spectrum averaged over different times (10, 20, 25, and 30 seconds). The background used is the 
average background from our sample.
